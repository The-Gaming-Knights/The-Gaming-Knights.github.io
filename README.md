We're a team of passionate young game designers who came together for the [OGPC competition], tackling this year's theme of [Extreme Weather](.
Our team is made up of various roles, from game designers and narrative writers to artists, sound designers, level designers, developers, and playtesters. Working collaboratively, we've brainstormed ideas, learned new tools like Godot and Git, and brought our vision for "Stormy Knight" to life. It's been a journey of creativity, problem-solving, and learning, and we're excited to share the result of our hard work with you!
